# **Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game**

## **Project Description:**
This project is a graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can challenge an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal moves, making it a highly competitive and challenging experience. The game is built using Python and the Pygame library to create an interactive graphical user interface.

## **Technologies Used:**
```bash
- Python: The core language for game logic and AI.
- Pygame: For creating the graphical user interface.
- Minimax Algorithm: To implement AI that plays optimally.
```

## **Features:**
- **Player vs. AI**: Players can choose to play as either 'X' or 'O' against a computer opponent.
- **Graphical Interface**: Intuitive interface to select roles, make moves, and restart the game.
- **Optimal AI Moves**: The AI is designed to play optimally using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Game End Detection**: Detects when a game is won or ends in a tie and displays the result.
- **Replayability**: After a game ends, players can restart without closing the application.

## **Gameplay Mechanics:**
1. The user selects their role ('X' or 'O') at the start.
2. Turns alternate between the user and the AI.
3. The AI calculates the best move using the Minimax algorithm, aiming for a win or draw.
4. The game checks for a winner or tie after each move.
5. The player can choose to play again after the game concludes.

## **Requisites:**
To run this game, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## **Code Overview:**
- **Game Loop**: The main loop handles event detection, rendering the game board, and handling user inputs.
- **AI Logic (Minimax Algorithm)**: The AI chooses the best possible move using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring it never loses if a win is possible.
- **Board Rendering**: The game board and moves are drawn using Pygame.
- **User Input Handling**: Mouse clicks are used to make moves and interact with the game.

## **Challenges Faced:**
- Efficient implementation of the Minimax algorithm for real-time gameplay.
- Designing a clean and responsive graphical interface.
- Ensuring smooth synchronization between AI decisions and player input.

## **Future Enhancements:**
- **Difficulty Levels**: Introduce varying AI difficulty settings.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow two human players to compete.
- **Sound Effects**: Add sounds for moves and game-end events to enhance user experience.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Adapt the game for mobile devices with touch support.
